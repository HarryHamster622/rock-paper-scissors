# rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple console game written entirely in javascript. Yes I know I could've used a switch instead of repeated else if statements, however switch cases were not a part of the program up to this point. 

By typing "game()" (without the quotations) in the console you will play a series of 5 rounds of "rock, paper, scissors!" against the computer, which will tally your wins and losses
